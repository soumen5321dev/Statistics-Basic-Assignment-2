    "Without the outlier (100), the mean of [10,12,14,16] would be 13, which is more representative of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is less affected by outliers because it is the middle value of a sorted dataset. Since it depends only on\n",
    "the order of the data, an extreme value does not influence it as much.\n",
    "Example: For the same dataset [10,12,14,16,100], the median is 14. Even if 100 is replaced with an extreme value\n",
    "like 1000, the median remains 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is unaffected by outliers since it depends on the frequency of occurrence. Outliers typically do not change\n",
    "the mode unless they are repeated often.\n",
    "Example: In the dataset [10,12,14,16,100], there is no mode, and introducing an outlier doesn’t create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is highly sensitive to outliers since it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. An\n",
    "outlier can significantly increase the range, making it less reflective of the typical spread.\n",

    "Without the outlier (100), the range of [10,12,14,16] would be 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variance and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both variance and standard deviation are affected by outliers because they involve the squared differences between\n",
    "each data point and the mean. An outlier can significantly increase these measures, indicating greater dispersion.\n",
    "Example: For the dataset [10,12,14,16,100], the mean is 30.4. The variance would be higher due to the large squared\n",
    "difference contributed by the outlier 100. The standard deviation, as the square root of variance, will also be\n",
